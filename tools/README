set CMD_LIST environment variable to an absolute path
set Make SHELL variable to cmd_shell.sh (absolute path)
^ "make SHELL=path-to-cmd_shell.sh"

cmd_shell.sh records cmds in CMD_LIST before passing them to bash

Depending on how recursive make is invoked this may or may not provide
all of the commands that make up the build.  It also might be necessary to
manually delete recipes which invoke make. It is also assumed that make
is executing recipes in the default way "sh -c 'recipe'".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

get_cmd_lists.sh takes a project name and the git url of that project

It checkouts fresh versions of the project for a certain number of commits and
writes the commands to build each commit to a different file.  This is useful
in the case where the build script is changing between commit versions.
