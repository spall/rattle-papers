Subsections that need to find a home at some point.

\subsection{Determinism}
\label{sec:determinism}

We use \texttt{.forward} files to get some determinism in some places. If a command is non-det we cope, but might have more restartable hazards. We assume that if given a set of files, a command previous wrote some inputs, then those inputs are still a plausible value. That is fine for commands that produce non-deteministic output (e.g. \texttt{ghc -c}), but no OK for commands where a stale result is invalid (e.g. \texttt{date}).

\subsection{Assumptions}

If you read a file that gets modified by something not under the observation of \Rattle (e.g. a human), then \Rattle will only be able to see the file after the command completes. It can use modification time to check, but you can change that too.
