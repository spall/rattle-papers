\section{Introduction}

Build systems make you specify a lot of stuff, but really you don't want to care, it's an abstraction. A command line uses what it uses.

Let's consider the VIM build system. It's wrong in lots of ways Sarah can describe. But these were expert software engineers - has anyone got it right? To a first approximation, no. Unless you go for something like Bazel, and then it's tedious but sandboxing makes you get it right.

In this paper we let you write a build system by specifying the list of tools to run \emph{in order}, but not with dependencies.

We're not the first people to do that, but the previous solutions have been hampered by making parallelism hard. We solve that with speculation.

In many ways we aren't the first to come up with this speculation idea. The CPU in your desktop computer already takes a series of instructions and executes them with pipelining and speculation. We just do the same with build commands.
