\section{Tracing}

Can only do files at the end.

We ignore files that are deleted after, they are temporary.

We'd like a more powerful oracle that intercepts each action, but that doesn't exist.

We'd like to know the precise time of each read/write, but we generalise to the time the command was running.

We use either fsatrace or libbigbro. That gives us call hooking on Windows, syscall hooking on Linux or \verb"LD_LIBRARY" preload on Linux.

We don't trace things like file system listings, modtime info etc. It's a little approx as a result.
