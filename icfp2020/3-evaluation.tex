\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Validating the claims from earlier}

In \S\ref{sec:introduction} we claimed that the following build script is ``just as good'' as a proper \Make script.

\begin{verbatim}

gcc -c main.c
gcc -c util.c
gcc -o main.exe main.o util.o

So, let's compare it on the axes that matter, and see where it is as good, and where it isn't.

Rattle:
Single threaded clean build = 0.84
Single threaded noop = 0.04
Single threaded with main.c changed (whitespace only) = 0.34
Single threaded with main.c changed = 0.72
Single threaded with main.c and util.c changed = 0.84

Multi threaded clean build = 0.84
Multi threaded noop = 0.04
Multi threaded with main.c changed (whitespace only) = 0.34
Multi threaded with main.c changed = 0.72
Multi threaded with main.c and util.c changed = 0.74
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Rest of the evaluation}

Let's consider the VIM build system. It's wrong in lots of ways Sarah can describe. But these were expert software engineers - has anyone got it right? To a first approximation, no. Unless you go for something like Bazel, and then it's tedious but sandboxing makes you get it right.
